# Oscillator-Circuit_13222083
A 357 kHz Colpitts oscillator using a NPN BJT 2N2222 with a 15 V power supply, achieving a 9â€“10 V peak-to-peak output and high sinusoidal purity.

This is a project regarding analogue circuit design and development, using polar capacitors, 2N2222, inductor, and some other hardware components. The circuit was built on top of breadboard and tested with laboratory equipments, such as oscilloscope, signal generators,DC power supply, and digital multimeter.

The .asc file can be simulated on LTspice, but the simulation result was different than the analogue circuit testing (See report).

There is a Google Sheet file that is used for fine tuning the circuit with LTspice (Sheet 1), calculating the quality of the oscillator circuit (Sheet 2), and parameters of the BJT (Sheet 3). Here's the link to the Google Sheet:
